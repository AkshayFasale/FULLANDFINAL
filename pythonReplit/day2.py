Day 2 Challenge
Getting to Know You Project
You can continue to use this same repl for your project. Just make sure you delete any previous code from our practice session.

Write code that does the following:

Asks for the user's name, favorite food, favorite music and where they live (or you can create other questions!)
Store all of the answers in different variables.
Print out a full sentence that includes the user's favorite things.
Give them a positive affirmation at the end - tell them they rock at doing something!
Example (go to the end for the solution...but no peeking):
Getting to know you!
You are
Mark
You're probably hungry for
Burritos
and you're definitely getting your groove on to
Synthwave and Anything by our man Rick Astley
living in the amazing
Edge of reality
